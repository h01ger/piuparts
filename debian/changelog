piuparts (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ David Steele ]
  * piuparts-reports.py:
    Revert "Don't add results from outdated binaries to summary.json" from
    0.94. The reverted commit is 62a6b3c438f42480ce3a08996ed4994de1561591.
    The patch was added to avoid incorporating summary.json reporting results
    for binary packages which are no longer part of the source package. It
    stopped Piuparts from blocking the source package from testing migration.
    It has a bug related to "upgrade test" sections, which cause a large
    number of packages to incorrectly be reported in the "waiting" state.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - Add '--merged-usr' support when using debootstrap to create the chroot.
    - Add '--distupgrade-to-testdebs-from DIR' as a shorthand for
      '--bindmount DIR --testdebs-repo DIR --distupgrade-to-testdebs'.
  * distros.conf:
    - wheezy* has been archived/removed.
    - jessie* has been partially archived/removed.
    - Add buster-backports.
    - Add bullseye-proposed-updates.
  * piuparts.conf:
    - Add section [sid-merged-usr], using --merged-usr.  (Closes: #848968)
    - Use --warn-on-debsums-errors for tests ending in buster.
    - Rename [stretch2proposed] to [stretch2next]
      and [buster2proposed] to [buster2next].
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - Keep recycled pass logs while waiting for new test results, continuing
      to show them as "successfully-tested" instead of "waiting-to-be-tested".
    - Add (hardcoded) list of missing dependencies that resolve to
      "ignore-does-not-exist".
      Used for packages to be skipped via "is_installable_*" scripts to
      exclude them from "dependency-does-not-exist" state.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - New option "slave-flush-interval" to flush logs more frequently to the
      master. Set to 30 minutes.
    - New option "chroot-meta-directory" to share reference target chroot
      metadata between slave instances.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Omit states with 0 packages from section summaries.
  * scripts/{post_chroot_unpack,pre_distupgrade}_allow_unauthenticated:
    - Disable Check-Valid-Until for wheezy/updates and jessie-backports.
  * scripts/post_distupgrade_exceptions:
    - Handle /var/lib/pam/seen stretch -> buster upgrade by running
      pam-auth-update if needed. Workaround for #920760.
  * scripts/pre_remove_40_find_unowned_lib_links:
    - Handle --merged-usr environments.
  * master-bin/reschedule_piuparts_tests: Do not act on 'bugged/*.log' and
    'affected/*.log' by default. Add --bugged, --affected flags.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Declare this release to be version 1.0.0, finally. May the force be with
    you.
  * htdocs/news.tpl:
    - add news about sid-merged-usr being tested.
    - add news about the 1.0.0 release.
  * piuparts_slave_join.8.txt: update revdate to date of last change.

      packages that would fail anyway, but are resource hogs or otherwise
      break piuparts.
    - Silence diff_meta_data() for "others" for --warn-on-others.
    - Store the initial package selections in the --save-end-meta meta-data

piuparts (0.48) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - Ignore *.dpkg-* conffile backups found in --scriptsdir directories.
    - Report attributes (for reference and current file) in case of file
      modification.
    - Report paths of installed files that contain symlinks (for better
      debugging of the problems caused by such a setup).
      ( test $(dirname $x) != $(readlink -f $(dirname $x)) )
    - Add debsums, processes, and broken-symlinks check after the first purge
      in --install-purge-install mode.
    - Add --install-recommends option, disabled by default.
    - Mark temporary directories with a .piuparts.tmpdir file.
    - Use rm -rf --one-file-system to delete chroots.
  * piuparts.conf:
    - New per section settings: expire-old-days, expire-fail-days (defaulting
      to 0 which means expiration is disabled).
    - Split and rename piuparts-cmd into piuparts-command ([global] setting
      that should include all common flags) and piuparts-flags (for additional
      section-specific flags).
    - Rename the tempdir setting to tmpdir, this will be used for the --tmpdir
      argument of piuparts, too.
  * piuparts-master.py:
    - Enable recycling before initializing the real package db.
    - Enable logging by default and set default log-file to
      $SECTION/master.log. Use "/dev/null" to disable logging.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Retry sections with higher precedence more often.
    - Construct the piuparts command line from the new config options
      piuparts-command, piuparts-flags, and tmpdir.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Don't hardcode section names, always show all known_problem reports.
  * detect_piuparts_issues: Catch the chroot running out of space.
  * reschedule_oldest_logs: Implement logfile expiration. Delete logfiles that
    are marked for recycling and are older than expire-{old,fail}-days. These
    packages have not been retested because of some dependency problem making
    the package currently untestable. Deleting the log will cause the package
    to be moved to dependency-failed-testing or similar state.
    expire-*-days needs to be greater than reschedule-*-days to enable this.
  * slave_cleanup: Only remove directories containing a .piuparts.tmpdir file.
  * New bug template: copyright_file_missing_after_upgrade.
  * New known problem: Installing something over existing symlinks.

  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Rewrite find_files_with_suffix(), handle disappearing files.
  * New custom script pre_remove_50_find_missing_copyright: check for missing
    /usr/share/doc/$package/copyright files.  (Closes: #683685)
  * Rename custom script post_install_find_bad_permissions to
    pre_remove_50_find_bad_permissions to avoid early failures during upgrade
    tests that may be fixed in a later version.

  * New known problem: Modifying conffiles or other shipped files.
  * New custom script post_distupgrade_hack_debsums to work around #687611
    which makes all debsum checks fail due to modification of

      + /var/lib/onioncat/
      + /var/lib/vmm/(./.*)?    (Closes: #682184)
    - Fix some leftover files and directories getting incorrectly accounted to
      the package being tested instead of the dependencies in --warn-on-others
      mode.
    - Implement --install-purge-install option: test purging with all
      dependencies still installed; re-install after purge.
    - Install the dependencies and snapshot the chroot before the
      --install-purge-install test.  Check that the chroot after purge matches
      the snapshot.  (Closes: #668713)
  * piupartslib/dependencyparser.py:
    - Package names may now have a ":any" qualification in some cases.  Extend
      the parser to recognize and discard this suffix.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - Implement logfile recycling mode that avoids getting a large backlog of
      untested packages due to uncoordinated log deletion.  Delay log deletion
      and give preference to packages (or versions) that have not yet been
      tested.  (Closes: #670150)
      + logfiles to be recycled should be hardlinked from pass/, fail/, ... to
        recycle/
      + recycling can be enabled if recycle/ is not empty
      + treat packages with logfile in recycle/ as initially "unknown" and
        compute state ("waiting[-for-dependency]-to-be-tested")
      + delete old logfile while reserving such a package
  * piuparts-master.py:
    - Accept and discard duplicate log submissions, preventing the slave from
      retrying infinitely.
    - Delay loading the Packages file which is only needed for "status" and
      "reserve" commands, but not for submitting logs.
    - Add "recycle" command to enter logfile recycling mode (needs to be
      issued before "status" or "reserve").
    - Remember idle state by creating stamp files.
    - Add "idle" command to check a remembered idle status before trying to
      "reserve" packages (avoid package state computation).  Idle status (i.e.
      no packages available for "reserve") will be remembered for an hour, but
      any log modification (submission, deletion, marking for recycling) will
      clear the idle status.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Fix stopping the currently running test (Ctrl-C Ctrl-C).
    - Handle master communication exceptions while sending logs or reserving
      packages: skip the section but keep the slave running.
    - Flush finished logs from sections that have processing postponed due to
      precedence settings.
    - Skip connection to master if we have reserved but no submittable logs.
    - Submit finished logs after completing all reserved logs in a section.
    - Send finished logs to master if interrupted with a single Ctrl-C.
    - Try to unreserve all reserved logs after interrupt.
    - Add SIGHUP handler that triggers flushing finished logs.  Flushing (all
      sections) will be done after the current test has finished.
    - Enter logfile recycling mode if no section has packages left for regular
      processing.  Recycle logfiles until a section becomes available for
      regular processing.  If no logfiles could be recycled, retry after an
      hour.
    - Issue "idle" command before "reserve" and skip status computation and
      reserving if master is idle.
  * Simplify running piuparts from GIT.
  * Reorganize layout in the GIT repository to reduce path nesting and length.
  * Makefile:
    - Separate build and install targets.
    - Adjust for new layout, cleanup, simplify.
  * conf/piuparts.apache: Set DefaultType text/plain (for the logfiles).
  * reschedule_oldest_logs: Hardlink old logfiles to recycle/ instead of
    deleting them.  Cleanup obsolete rescheduling requests.
  * New helper script: master-bin/reclassify_bugged.
  * New custom script post_setup_forbid_home: replace /home with a file to
    prevent creating home directories there.  (Closes: #677332)
  * New custom script post_install_find_bad_permissions: look for world
    writable directories without sticky bit set.

    - add to self.ignored_files: /etc/blkid.tab (Closes: #638831)
    - add to self.ignored_patterns: /var/lib/apt/lists/.*
    - apply patch by Gregor Herrmann to fix --minimize. (Closes: #648423)
  * Remove Debian.NEWS entry about source in git. (Closes: #640121)
  * piuparts.py, piuparts-report.py, ChangeLog: Expand tabs to spaces.
  * Remove whitespaces from whitespace-only lines.
  * piuparts-report:
    - create maintainer subdirs if they don't exist.
    - detect tests being terminated due to excessive output.
  * Add git to Build-Depends-Indep: as git describe is used to generate
    part of the version string for development builds.
  * Add debian/.gitignore

  [ Mika Pflüger ]
  * piuparts-analyze.py:
    - Rewrite to use python-debianbts to analyze if bugs are filed already.
    - The BTS only tracks source versions, so remove binNMU-part from
      package versions when comparing with versions from the BTS.
    - Reduce noise in the output by only printing one action/advise per
      package.
    - Fix extraction of package versions from bug reports. Thanks to
      Andreas Beckmann for catching and solving the error.
  * debian/control: Add python-apt and python-debianbts to piuparts depends.

  [ Scott Schaefer ]
  * debian/copyright: Make it compliant with DEP-5.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Replace deprecated os.popen2 with subprocess.Popen. (Closes: #640646)
    - Add some more logging.
    - Kill children (hard-coded value, 45 minutes) to ensure test doesn't
      run "forever" (Closes: #640647, #387428)
  * piuparty.py:
    - Kill leftover processes (via SIGTERM, then if that fails, via SIGKILL).
      (Closes: #522918)
    - Test for incorrect diversion handling:  (Closes: #588313)
      a) Existing diversions removed/modified, and/or
      b) Installed diversions not removed by purge.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py: Modify several functions in PackagesDB class
    to use python 'set' type, instead of a list.  This permitted replacing
    inefficient combination of unique() function and random.shuffle() with
    python set.pop() method.  Since python prohibits storing non-hashable
    object in a set, minor modifications to piuparts-report and to
    piuparts-master required. (Closes: #640648)

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * *.py: Add vim modeline.
  * piuparts.py:
    - Add unittests for misbehaving symlinks.
    - Fix resolving absolute symlinks of intermediate directory components,
      i.e. /var/run -> /run while checking /etc/motd -> /var/run/motd.
      Solves about 30000 false positives of
      'Broken symlinks: /etc/motd -> /var/run/motd'.  (Closes: #648784)
    - When running commands in the chroot, redirect stdin from /dev/null.
    - Stop using Popen.communicate() as it may run out of memory.
    - Terminate commands producing more than 2 MB of output. (Closes: #649335)
    - Create /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/ if missing inside the chroot (e.g. on
      lenny).  (Closes: #647752)
    - Remove logrotate and its dependencies only once.
    - Only run 'apt-get update' after updating the sources.list.
    - Only run 'apt-get clean' before creating tarballs or saving meta data.
    - Do the same checks for running processes and broken symlinks in all
      tests.  (Closes: #648708)
    - Create piupart's apt config in the chroot as /etc/apt.conf.d/piuparts
      instead of /etc/apt.conf in order to allow overriding the settings from
      custom scripts by just dropping new config bits in e.g.
      /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/piuparts-foobar.
    - Integrate diversion checks with Chroot.check_result().
    - Use 'apt-get remove' to remove all packages at once with proper
      dependency ordering.  (Closes: #648162)
    - Purge all packages at once instead of doing it one-by-one.
    - Make restore_selections() reinstall missing packages.  (Closes: #648707)
    - Set more environment variables to let custom scripts know where and
      when they are being run: PIUPARTS_TEST, PIUPARTS_PHASE,
      PIUPARTS_DISTRIBUTION{,_PREV,_NEXT}.  See the README for details.
      (Closes: #589498)
    - Add missing post_install_* custom scripts to install_packages_by_name().
      (Closes: #628077)
    - Remove pre_upgrade_* custom scripts, they can be replaced with
      pre_install_* scripts that check for PIUPARTS_PHASE=upgrade.
    - Add pre_test_* custom scripts.  These are run exactly once at the
      beginning of each test (after recording the initial chroot state).
    - Allow multiple --scriptsdir options, the contents will be merged.
    - Exclude /tmp/scripts when creating a tarball.
    - Use --one-file-system when creating a tarball to exclude bindmounts etc.
    - Restore base system from temp_tgz instead of running debootstrap again.
      (Closes: #648193)
    - Do not fail upgrade/distupgrade tests for a set of packages where not
      all packages exist in the start distribution.  This happens e.g. when
      testing .changes files and packages were split/added. Only install the
      old packages that actually exist according to 'apt-cache show'.
    - Add --extra-old-packages option to intall additional old packages that
      are not in the set of new packages to be tested.  Useful for testing
      upgrades with Conflicts/Replaces relationships, e.g. in package renames
      or merges.
    - Use consistent variable names for package lists.  (Closes: #648177)
    - Compute the changes in restore_selections().
    - Check for settings.scriptsdir inside run_scripts().
    - Consistently use chroot.relative() to build filenames inside the chroot.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - Handle 'unknown-preferred-alternative' state correctly.
    - Add 'does-not-exist' state for dependency resolution to distinguish this
      from 'unknown' state so that the latter only indicates 'unresolvable' or
      'not yet resolved'.
    - Handle virtual packages separately from real packages.
    - Use get_package_state() internally which 'resolves' (purely) virtual
      packages by default (can be disabled).
  * piuparts-master.py:
    - Add a 'status' command that reports package counts for all states.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Fix triggering tarball recreation.
    - Check tarball age regularily.
    - Log tarball creation in *.tgz.log.
    - Request and print package counts from master.
    - Reload section config every time a section is being run.
    - Add precedence attribute to allow prioritizing different sections and to
      suspend processing of low priority ones while there are packages waiting
      in more important sections.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - state-*.html: Sort package lists by name, display state of all
      alternative dependencies and packages providing a virtual dependency.
    - source/?/*.html: Sort binary packages by name.
    - maintainer/?/*.html: Sort source packages by name.
    - Update list of error states to be highlighted.
    - Archive logs of packages that were removed from the distribution.
    - Speedup generating maintainer summaries.
  * Makefile: Use 'git describe' to get an exact stamp for development
    versions.

  [ Dave Steele ]
  * piuparts-slave.py: make Section.run() report the number of packages
    processed and use this to decide whether a slave should sleep.
    (Closes: #649967)

  [ Stefano Rivera ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - Properly install and remove logrotate.  (Closes: #638832)
    - Use eatmydata by default, add option --no-eatmydata. (This was discussed
      in #633033.)

piuparts (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py: Apply patch by Scott Schaefer to also consider
    alternative depends: the algorithm used to select the "best" alternative
    is:
     1) Prefer first alternative in state "essential-required"
     2) If no "essential-required" alternatives, prefer first alternative
        in state "successfully-tested"
     3) Otherwise, prefer first alternative in state
        "waiting-to-be-tested" IF NO REMAINING alternatives are in one of the
        "unknown/fail" states
    For this two new states have been introduced:
     a) "unknown-preferred-alternative": equivalent of "unknown", this defers
        calculation of this package's state, since one or more of its
        alternative depends are "unknown" (or
        "unknown-preferred-alternative"), and no alternative is either
        "essential-required" or "successfully-tested".  The alternatives will
        be re-tested on subsequest pass.
     b) "no-dependency-from-alternatives-exists": if none of the alternatives
        can be found in the archive.
    (Closes: #526045)
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - correct a typo from the patch for #523950.
    - make_stats_graph: draw the two new states as well.
    - point to source code in git instead of svn.
  * piuparts.py:
    - use proxy settings either from apt configuration or http_proxy
      environment variable, the latter overwriting the former (if present)
      - Thanks to Scott Schaefer for the patch. (Closes: #632046)
    - new option "--no-install-purge-test" to only do upgrade tests
      - Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for the patch (Closes: #588482)
    - run dpkg with --force-unsafe-io by default and introduce new option
      "--dpkg-noforce-unsafe-io" to disable this feature. (Closes: #633033)
      Thanks to Scott once more!
    - new option: "--fail-on-broken-symlinks". Remove option "--warn-symlinks"
      as this is the default now.
  * piuparts-slave:
    - check if chroot-tgz is older than max-tgz-age (defaulting to 30 days)
      and recreate it, if it is. Keep backup and put in back in place when
      debootstrapping a new chroot-tgz fails. Retry after min-tgz-retry-delay
      seconds. Thanks to Scott Schaefer for the patch. (Closes: #632924)
    - document new configuration options max-tgz-age and min-tgz-retry-delay
      in README.txt.
    - fix bug in piuparts-slave which prevented running a single section by
      including section name as command-line argument - thanks again to Scott
      and see 632924 too.
  * debian/control:
    - require python >= 2.6.6-3~, get rid of python-support build-depends.
    - add X-Python-Version: pseudo-header
  * debian/rules: use dh_python2 instead of python-support to build the
    package
  * Makefile: build for python 2.6 and 2.7 instead of 2.5 and 2.6.
  * Source code is now stored in git.
    https://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=piuparts/piuparts.git
    git clone git+ssh://git.debian.org/git/piuparts/piuparts.git
    Thanks to Thomas Koch for setting those up and keeping history!
  * The configuration and scripts used on piatti.debian.org have also been
    moved to git, the URLs are the same, just s#piuparts#piatti#.
  * Add entry about git to NEWS.
  * Update Vcs-*-Headers in control to reflect move to git.

piuparts (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * piuparts.py:
    - make "natty" the default Ubuntu distribution.
    - add to self.ignored_files:
      - /var/log/bootstrap.log
  * debian/control: depend on ${python:Depends} instead of just python. Thanks
    to Jakub Wilk. (Closes: #614617)

    to Carl Chenet for a first patch and Scott Schaefer for the applied one.
    (Closes: #523950)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2, no changes necessary.
  * debian/rules: add empty build-arch and build-indep to appease lintian.
  * Makefile: drop workaround for #559305 in lenny.

piuparts (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * The vintage of 2010 release!
  * piuparts-report.py:
     - report packages which failed
       - due to broken maintainer scripts,
       - due to output from cron after removal,
       - due to not enough force being,
       - due to a problem with pre-depends,
       - due to files having been modified after purge,
       - due to files having disappeared after purge and
       - due to problems configuring a database.
     - only report about (un)owned files and directories and symlink issues in
       sid - that's hardcoded as it's not practical to track them anywhere else
       anyway. And at least for broken symlinks this will also stay like this
       for a long time.
     - visual improvements in the output.
     - ignore udebs and binaries from other archs too.
     - graph is generated using all the available data points.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - automatically break circular dependencies when there are only circular
      dependencies left, using a configurable list of circular depdencies in
      piuparts.conf (Closes: #526046)
        The list of circular depends is taken from a script written by Robert
      Lemmen available at http://debian.semistable.com/debgraph.out.html -
      obviously it would be better to merge this into piuparts directly.
        Note that the dependency resovler is still buggy, the state
      waiting-for-dependency-to-be-tested still contains some packages
      with failed depends (due to them being dependent on packages with
      circular depends). This bug has no effect other than that (so the state
      waiting-to-be-tested is calculated correctly). This bug is also no
      regression.
    - get rid of the longtime unused states "fixed" and "fix-not-yet-tested"
      (also in piuparts-master and piuparts-report).
    - forget reservations of untestable packages.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - fix crash when going into sleep when idle.
    - add support for only doing upgrade tests (without the basic test in the
      upgrade target distro).
    - honor mirror configuration option also for upgrade-tests.
    - also do upgrade tests if the version of a package being tested (the one
      in the upgraded distro) is not available in the distro being upgraded
      from. (This is a very short test, but a successfully one.)
    - make configuration setting "distro" to not default to any distro.
  * piuparts.py:
    - new option: --log-level to specify the verbosity of piuparts
      output. Thanks to Fabrice Coutadeur for the patch! (Closes: #567190)
    - new option: --warn-on-leftovers-after-purge to not fail if a package
      leaves files behind after purge. (Closes: #566599)
    - add to self.ignored_files:
      - /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/.delete-me-later
      - /var/log/alternatives.log (Closes: #591966)
      - /var/log/apt/history.log (Closes: #594964)
      - /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/fonts.alias (Closes: #576321)
    - add to self.ignored_patterns:
      - /etc/init.d/.depend.*
      - /var/mail(/.*)? - this used to be just /var/mail/.*
      - /var/lib//update-rc.d(/.*)? (Closes: #605127)
    - create temporary DEBIAN directory for the piuparts-depends-dummy package
      with 0755 perms regardless of the umask of the calling shell.
      (Closes: #573904)
    - fix --do-not-verify-signatures option (Closes: #574936) - thanks to
      Cleto Martin Angelina for the patch.
    - make Chroot.diff_meta_data() special case and ignore files matching
      (/etc/rc.\.d/)[SK][0-9]{2}(.*)$ so that piuparts doesn't complain about
      initscripts renamed by insserv. Thanks to by Andreas Beckmann for the
      patch! (Closes: #586793)
    - remove logrotate and depended packages after the test. (Closes: #602409)
      This is a fix for the incomplete patch for #566597. Again, this is a
      hardcoded list. :-(
    - new custom script: pre_remove_ (Closes: #539146)
    - set environment variable PIUPARTS_OBJECTS in custom scripts to a space
      separated list of packages / changes files being tested.
    - do not call apt-get with --no-remove when installing packages.
      (Closes: #603453)
    - apply patch by Andres Mejia to fix parsing of the --force-confdef option
      and also to configure apt to use that option. Thanks, Andres.
      (Closes: #605475)
    - don't panic if package is not known by apt-get, this probably just means
      a package not yet in the archive is being tested. (Closes: #566672)
      Thanks to Cleto Martin Angelina for the patch!
    - fix parsing of the options --end-meta and --save-end-meta.
    - supply help texts for --end-meta and --save-end-meta options, also add
      comments to install_and_upgrade_between_distros() to make the code
      easier to understand and hopefully improve in future. (Closes: #560050).
    - add logging to install_and_upgrade_between_distros() to point people to
      read the functions source code if they wonder why the log (for distro
      upgrade tests) looks like it looks.
  * piuparts.1.txt:
    - update the pointer to custom-scripts.txt to point to README.txt, as
      those two files have been merged. Thanks to Gregor Hermann for
      spotting this. (Closes: #574504)
    - indicate that it's possible to check several packages or .changes files
      at once.
    - update several options descritpions.
  * README.txt
    - better documentation of custom scripts.
    - reformat to achieve consistent width.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to Depends in debian/control.
  * Remove versioned dependencies on debootstrap as the version available
    in Etch is sufficient. Drop build-depends on dpkg-dev as it's in
    build-essential.
  * Build-depend on debhelper>=7 and use dh_prep instead of dh_clean -k, bump
    compat level to 7.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1, no changes necessary.
  * Remove Ian Jackson from uploaders - thanks for your work, Ian!
  * Makefile: support python 2.5 and 2.6 instead of 2.4 and 2.5, adjust
    debian/control accordingly.
  * debian/preinst: update code snipplet rm_conffile() from
    https://wiki.debian.org/DpkgConffileHandling

  [ Evgeni Golov ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - Check for remaining logrotate files which produce output after the

piuparts (0.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * piuparts.py:
    - Add support for using LVM snapshots. Thanks to
      Patrick Schoenfeld for the patch. (Closes: #559449)
    - Add support for warning on broken symlinks. Thanks to Carl Chenet for
      the patch. (Closes: #440151)
    - Make --help usuable without needing to be run as root. (Closes: #547379)
    - --skip-minimize is now the default. This is because debootstrap is called
      with --variant=minbase instead of --resolv-deps now and because if a
      base.tgz or an lvm snapshot is specified, piuparts should not touch it.
      (Closes: #539142, #559048)
      Introduce a new option, --minimize, to minimize a chroot with debfoster.
      (This is the old default behaviour. In future versions the --minimize
      option might be removed again.)
    - Add two new options: --keyring to specify the keyring to use with
      debootstrap (defaults to /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg)
      and --do-not-verify-signatures to not use --keyring with debootstrap.
      (Closes: #545907)
      In the chroots, APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated is set accordingly in
      /etc/apt/apt.conf.
    - Add new option, --pedantic-purge-test, to tell piuparts to be pedantic
      when checking if a purged package leaves files behind. If this option is
      not set, files left in /tmp are ignored. (Closes: #528266)
    - Add new option, --dpkg-force-confdef, to make dpkg use --force-confdev,
      which lets dpkg always choose the default action when a modified conffile
      is found. This options will make piuparts ignore errors it was designed
      to report and therefore should only be used to hide problems in
      dependent packages. (Closes: #466118)
    - Add another type of custom-scripts, post_setup_, which are executed after
      the chroot was setup. (Closes: #466043)
    - Create policy-rc.d in 2nd chroot when using -b. (Closes: #466049)
      Thanks again to Patrick Schoenfeld for his help.
  * piuparts-report: report broken symlinks.
  * piuparts-slave:
    - gracefully deal with upgrade-test-distros and upgrade-test-chroot-tgz
      not being set in the configuration. Thanks to Carl Chenet and Patrick
      Schoenfeld for the patch. (Closes: #519192)
    - new default value for idle-sleep, 300 instead of 10 seconds. Also the
      slave will now only sleep if there is nothing to do for any section.
  * Makefile: workaround 559305 by calling a2x twice.
  * Update debian/NEWS.
  * Replace all references to sarge and etch with ones to lenny and squeeze.

    - change some methods from using 'args' to 'package_list'. This more
      accurately represents what is being passed into these methods now.
    - add an optional parameter to panic() method to specify what exit status
      to use. Also thanks to Andres.
    - add advice how to read the logfile to the top of the logfiles produced.
    - add "FAIL: " to logging output for seven more failure types, so that it
      becomes easier to group failure causes.
    - allow piuparts to be stopped with control-C. Thanks to Carl Chenet for
      the patch. (Closes: #523958)
    - fail gracefully if piuparts is run as non-root user. Thanks to Ignace
      Mouzannar for the patch. (Closes: #538273)
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - change the test whether a package is testable to check whether the
      package is of priority "required", and not whether it's "Essential".
    - rename status "essential-required-important" to "essential-required"
      as important packages can be tested like all the others.
    - handle binNMUs where the Source header in the Packages file includes the
      Version and the Source package name in one line.
    - fix get_packages_in_state() to only return unique packages and not also
      the provided ones as exact copies.
  * Install scripts for master-slave mode without .py extension.
  * piuparts-master.py: remove code to write statistics, that is done only in
    piuparts-report.py now.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - support looping trough multiple sections in piuparts.conf via new config
      value "sections". Thanks to Frank Ploss for writing this patch with me
      and helping me understand the code much better!
    - allow the user to stop the slave with control-C.
    - call piuparts with --mirror when mirror is set in piuparts.conf.
  * Re-add piuparts-reports.py which got removed/lost between 0.14 and 0.20
    without changelog entry.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - support sections in configuration file.
    - support looping trough multiple sections in piuparts.conf via new config
      value "sections".
    - generate counts.txt (per section) with raw numbers of packages per state,
      include these stats in the debug output (so it gets included in the mails
      send by cron.)
    - introduce new setting "sources-url" for piuparts.conf.
    - generate sources.txt (per section) with a summary status per source
      package (for the PTS to display a source packages piuparts state)
    - generate html status pages for all source packages (to link from the PTS)
      with links to state explaination and available logfiles, handle udebs.
    - provide links to logfiles in statistics page.
    - provide links to source packages pages from state pages and back, as well
      as links to the dependencies state.
    - draw graphs of package states over time (if pypthon-rpy and gs are
      installed) - thanks to Thomas Viehmann and Dirk Eddelbüttel for
      inspiration and support.
    - create maintainer centric pages for each email address found in
      Maintainers or Uploaders.
    - improve layout, generate navigation for all pages.
    - use icons to provide a quick overview of a source packages status.
      (Thanks to tango.freedesktop.org for the icons!)
    - include index.tpl (if it exists) from output-directory into the
      generated index page, so one can add news to the index page without
      editing piuparts-report.py.
    - generate pages for known issues, which are detected by bash helper
      script, run by cron on piuparts.debian.org and available from
      svn/piuparts/piatti/home/piupartsm/bin/detect_well_known_errors
  * Always use alphabetic time zone abbreviation in timestamps.
  * Makefile:
    - add "~$date" to versionstring if building an unreleased version, thus
      adding dpkg-dev to build-depends.
    - split install target into install-doc, install-conf and install, to aid
      development and deployment from trunk.
  * debian/control:
    - depend on python (>>2.4), make dependency to python-debian unversioned.
    - add build-dependencies on debhelper, asciidoc and xmlto.
    - dependency gs has been renamed to ghostcript
    - remove build-dependencies on docbook2x and docbook-xml.
    - suggest python-rpy and gs to improve piuparts-report output.
    - set Homepage: to http://piuparts.debian.org
    - remove Lucas Nussbaum, Ana Guerrero, John Wright and Bill Allombert from
      uploaders - thanks for your work!
    - Replace Ians email address with one that doesn't give an errorcode when
      sending mail to it
    - bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3, no changes necessary.
  * Rewrite debian/rules from scratch using debhelper.
  * Merge README, how-to-use-piuparts.txt and custom-scripts.txt into
    README.txt, convert it to asciidoc and build pdf and html versions of it.
  * Restructure and update README.txt to reflect the configuration changes in
    master-slave mode.
  * Add debian/NEWS file.
  * Rewrite piuparts manpage in asciidoc.
  * Build and install html version of the piuparts manpage.

    pack_into_tgz(). Minor refactorings. Thanks go to Tobias Grimm
    for the patch. (Closes: #478577)
  * Move piuparts to priority: extra, since it depends on debootstrap which

piuparts (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez ]
  * Updated uploaders, remove Amaya and Alastair.

  [ Lars Wirzenius ]
  * piuparts.py: Call "apt-get update" before calling Chroot.minimize, so
    that we can find the debfoster package on Ubuntu.
  * debian/control: Fixed "Uploaders:" to have my preferred e-mail address
    (liw@iki.fi) instead of my Debian one.
  * piuparts.py: Added -D option to set Debian flavor, plus two sets of
    default settings depending on the flavor, one for Debian itself, and
    another for Ubuntu. The settings choose default mirror and distribution
    set (sid vs gutsy). This will allow an Ubuntu version of the package
    to set defaults at package building time.
  * piuparts.py: Report target of broken symlink correctly, instead of
    saying "True".
  * piuparts.py: Use lsb-release to guess the Debian flavor.
  * debian/control: Added dependency on lsb-release.
  * piuparts-master.py: Make the master write summary of total pass/fail
    packages, plus status per binary package. This is for having the
    Debian PTS and the Ubuntu developer weather report show summaries
    of piuparts results.
  * integraged changes from Ubuntu by Ian Jackson to support autopkgtest.
  * wrapped long lines in debian/control.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Added myself to uploaders.
  * Added Homepage: header to debian/control and changed the homepage to be
    https://wiki.debian.org/piuparts.
  * Use Vcs-* headers in debian/control instead of XS-Vcs-*.
  * Bumped policy version to 3.7.3.
  * Updated download location in debian/copyright.

  [ John Wright ]
  * Change the --warn-on-others implementation to create a dummy metapackage
    with the needed dependencies and install it in the chroot, rather than
    using "apt-get install package package-".  The previous implementation
    had issues when the package was already installed (and especially if the
    package had essential packages in its reverse dependencies).  This has
    the pleasant side-effect of making --warn-on-others work both with and
    without --apt. (Closes: #458929)
  * Fix a bug in check_for_broken_symlinks(): the targets for the broken
    symlinks (used for logging) were being read from files on the real root
    filesystem, rather than in the chroot.

    piuparts-master.py and piuparts-slave.py.  Please see the README file,
    piuparts-master.conf.sample and piuparts-slave.conf.sample for more
    details. (Closes: #349365)
  * Fix the --warn-on-others option.  Now, dependencies are installed before
    the packages we wish to test, and an inventory is taken then, so that we
    can know which errors were caused by the packages explicitly specified on
    the command-line.  Currently, this requires --apt, and doesn't work quite
    as advertised if there are circular dependencies with the packages you wish
    to test (see the man page for more details). (Closes: #440310)
