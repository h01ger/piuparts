piuparts (0.45) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Merge piatti.git into piuparts.git, so that piatti.git has become obsolete
    now. Update documentation accordingly.

  [ David Steele ]
  * Remove debian/postinst as it was only dealing with lenny time area
    configuration files.
  * Added server configuration files for apache, sudo, and cron.
  * packagesdb.py:
    - Calculate recursive reverse dependency count, and store in PackagesDB.
    - Calculate the count of packages being blocked by a failed package.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Release Section object when section processing is complete.
      (Closes: #673919)
    - Display reverse dependency counts and block counts to failure summaries.
    - Sort the failed-testing and cannot-be-tested summaries by block count.
      (Closes: #674498)
    - Replace O(n^2) search in remove_old_logs() with a hash
      piuparts-report run time improved 20% on mature environment.
    - Another search fix in create_package_summaries (find_links_to_logs)
      yielding a 10x speedup for piuparts-report runs.
      (Closes: #674672)

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - Implement --install-remove-install option to test installation in
      config-files-remaining state.  (Closes: #359154)
    - Report leftover symlinks with target.
    - Report leftover directories with a trailing slash.
    - Allow ignore entries to specifically match directories.
    - Ignore patterns need to match the full filename, not a substring.
    - Cleanup and regroup ignore lists.
      + Remove many obsolete entries not needed for squeeze or later.
      + Group ignore entries into piuparts state, system state, package
        management, logfiles, home directories, application data, and HACKS.
    - Add to ignored_files/ignored_patterns:
      + Default system logfiles as created by syslogd in /var/log/
      + Common empty directories in /etc not removed due to dpkg bug #316521
      + cdebconf status files

      + /var/lib/openvswitch/(pki/.*)?
      + /var/spool/powerdns/                    (Closes: #531134, #531135)
    - Implement a timeout for commands being run in the chroot.
    - Set time limit to 30 minutes per command. (Closes: #654423)
    - Terminate all processes running inside the chroot before removing the
      chroot; also in case piuparts aborts due to an error.
    - Continue killing running processes as long as new processes get spawned
      in the chroot.
  * piuparts.conf:
    - Make master-command a [global] instead of a [section] setting.
      The section name will be given as an argument to this command.
    - Removed deprecated keys: known_circular_depends.
  * master/db/report: Add a new category /affected/ for failed logs where the
    bug is in a dependency, but only exposed by the package being tested.
    - In the BTS these are reported as          (Closes: #657740)
        Package: buggy-package
        Version: buggy-version
        Affects: package-under-test
        Found: package-under-test/tested-version
    - Reschedule /affected/ logs like /fail/ logs.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - Do not consider a package as "untestable" if untestable/ contains a
      logfile from an obsolete version of that package.
    - Simplify handling of package and dependency states.
    - Do not inherit 'dependency-does-not-exist' state (which may be fixed
      in the package) but propagate it to 'dependency-cannot-be-tested'.
    - Remove 'no-dependency-from-alternatives-exists' state and use
      'dependency-does-not-exist' instead.
    - Remove 'unknown-preferred-alternative' state as it interferes with
      circular dependencies involving alternatives and virtual packages.
    - Fix state resolution of package dependencies containing alternatives,
      virtual packages and circular dependencies.
    - Remove 'circular-dependency' state.
    - Stop using static known_circular_depends.
    - Compute dependency cycles and test packages on such cycles if all
      non-circular dependencies are satisfied.
    - Consider any combination of two error states for the blocking count.
  * piuparts-master.py:
    - Remove known_circular_depends handling.
    - Reduce logfile verboseness: do not include received logs.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Randomize waiting time (between 60 and 180 seconds) if master is busy.
    - Sleep until the next section can be tried, but at least 1 minute.
    - Simplify and merge Section.setup() into Section.__init__().
    - Generate master command: use global setting and append section.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Remove known_circular_depends handling.
    - Exclude obsolete states from generated report.
    - Establish packagesdb working directory in Section.
    - Handle logs in /affected/ directories.
    - detect_well_known_errors: Add bug links if bugs are known.
    - New known problem: "packages have been kept back".
    - Report rdeps and blocking counts in all error state reports.
  * piuparts-analyze.py:
    - Don't report further bugs/versions if we found a match.
    - Classify logs with bugs filed into /bugged/ or /affected/.
    - Write .bug files with links to the BTS.
  * detect_archive_issues: Only consider logs older than one day for marking
    as "untestable" to allow piuparts-analyze to handle the log first.

  [ Leo Iannacone ]
  * piuparts.py: add --existing-chroot option, specify a directory as source
    for the chroot, instead of building a new one with debootstrap or
    decompress an archived one.  (Closes: #658044)

  [ Mika Pflüger ]
  * piuparts.py: Remove obsolete functions shellquote, apt_get_knows, and
    append_to_file.

  [ Mehdi Abaakouk ]
  * piuparts.py: Add support for schroot. (Closes #530733)

    - Skip misconfigured sections that have neither 'distro' nor
      'upgrade-test-distros' in their config.  (Closes: #668863)
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Add link to the list of untestable logs.
    - Add more known problem reports: forgotten alternatives, warnings in
      passed logs: leftover files and failed maintainer scripts.
    - Do not abort if logfiles disappear during copying.
  * Makefile: Install documentation with mode 0644 instead of 0755.

  [ Holger Levsen ]

    - Unset DISPLAY variable before running commands in the chroot.
    - Read possibly remaining buffered output after a command terminated.
    - Run apt-cache policy on the packages to be installed.

    - Fix chdir in/out of the slave dir to work with relative paths.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - Reorder the list of known problem analyses and add a few new ones.
    - Correctly split + strip comma-separated lists.
  * piuparts-analyze.py:
    - Also consider bugs that 'affects' a package.
    - Treat bugs without 'found' version as older than anything.
  * Makefile: Support version number substitution in piuparts-*.py, too.

    - add support for more static pages and add bug_howto.tpl, explaining how
      to file meaningful bugs piuparts-analyse understands. This page also
      links to the templates used for bug filing.
  * piuparts-slave.py: make status message more useful by including the
    section.

 -- Holger Levsen <holger@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Jan 2012 13:03:59 +0100

piuparts (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - add to self.ignored_files: /etc/blkid.tab (Closes: #638831)
    - add to self.ignored_patterns: /var/lib/apt/lists/.*
    - apply patch by Gregor Herrmann to fix --minimize. (Closes: #648423)
  * Remove Debian.NEWS entry about source in git. (Closes: #640121)
  * piuparts.py, piuparts-report.py, ChangeLog: Expand tabs to spaces.
  * Remove whitespaces from whitespace-only lines.
  * piuparts-report:
    - create maintainer subdirs if they don't exist.
    - detect tests being terminated due to excessive output.
  * Add git to Build-Depends-Indep: as git describe is used to generate
    part of the version string for development builds.
  * Add debian/.gitignore

  [ Mika Pflüger ]
  * piuparts-analyze.py:
    - Rewrite to use python-debianbts to analyze if bugs are filed already.
    - The BTS only tracks source versions, so remove binNMU-part from
      package versions when comparing with versions from the BTS.
    - Reduce noise in the output by only printing one action/advise per
      package.
    - Fix extraction of package versions from bug reports. Thanks to
      Andreas Beckmann for catching and solving the error.
  * debian/control: Add python-apt and python-debianbts to piuparts depends.

  [ Scott Schaefer ]
  * debian/copyright: Make it compliant with DEP-5.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Replace deprecated os.popen2 with subprocess.Popen. (Closes: #640646)
    - Add some more logging.
    - Kill children (hard-coded value, 45 minutes) to ensure test doesn't
      run "forever" (Closes: #640647, #387428)
  * piuparty.py:
    - Kill leftover processes (via SIGTERM, then if that fails, via SIGKILL).
      (Closes: #522918)
    - Test for incorrect diversion handling:  (Closes: #588313)
      a) Existing diversions removed/modified, and/or
      b) Installed diversions not removed by purge.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py: Modify several functions in PackagesDB class
    to use python 'set' type, instead of a list.  This permitted replacing
    inefficient combination of unique() function and random.shuffle() with
    python set.pop() method.  Since python prohibits storing non-hashable
    object in a set, minor modifications to piuparts-report and to
    piuparts-master required. (Closes: #640648)

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * *.py: Add vim modeline.
  * piuparts.py:
    - Add unittests for misbehaving symlinks.
    - Fix resolving absolute symlinks of intermediate directory components,
      i.e. /var/run -> /run while checking /etc/motd -> /var/run/motd.
      Solves about 30000 false positives of
      'Broken symlinks: /etc/motd -> /var/run/motd'.  (Closes: #648784)
    - When running commands in the chroot, redirect stdin from /dev/null.
    - Stop using Popen.communicate() as it may run out of memory.
    - Terminate commands producing more than 2 MB of output. (Closes: #649335)
    - Create /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/ if missing inside the chroot (e.g. on
      lenny).  (Closes: #647752)
    - Remove logrotate and its dependencies only once.
    - Only run 'apt-get update' after updating the sources.list.
    - Only run 'apt-get clean' before creating tarballs or saving meta data.
    - Do the same checks for running processes and broken symlinks in all
      tests.  (Closes: #648708)
    - Create piupart's apt config in the chroot as /etc/apt.conf.d/piuparts
      instead of /etc/apt.conf in order to allow overriding the settings from
      custom scripts by just dropping new config bits in e.g.
      /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/piuparts-foobar.
    - Integrate diversion checks with Chroot.check_result().
    - Use 'apt-get remove' to remove all packages at once with proper
      dependency ordering.  (Closes: #648162)
    - Purge all packages at once instead of doing it one-by-one.
    - Make restore_selections() reinstall missing packages.  (Closes: #648707)
    - Set more environment variables to let custom scripts know where and
      when they are being run: PIUPARTS_TEST, PIUPARTS_PHASE,
      PIUPARTS_DISTRIBUTION{,_PREV,_NEXT}.  See the README for details.
      (Closes: #589498)
    - Add missing post_install_* custom scripts to install_packages_by_name().
      (Closes: #628077)
    - Remove pre_upgrade_* custom scripts, they can be replaced with
      pre_install_* scripts that check for PIUPARTS_PHASE=upgrade.
    - Add pre_test_* custom scripts.  These are run exactly once at the
      beginning of each test (after recording the initial chroot state).
    - Allow multiple --scriptsdir options, the contents will be merged.
    - Exclude /tmp/scripts when creating a tarball.
    - Use --one-file-system when creating a tarball to exclude bindmounts etc.
    - Restore base system from temp_tgz instead of running debootstrap again.
      (Closes: #648193)
    - Do not fail upgrade/distupgrade tests for a set of packages where not
      all packages exist in the start distribution.  This happens e.g. when
      testing .changes files and packages were split/added. Only install the
      old packages that actually exist according to 'apt-cache show'.
    - Add --extra-old-packages option to intall additional old packages that
      are not in the set of new packages to be tested.  Useful for testing
      upgrades with Conflicts/Replaces relationships, e.g. in package renames
      or merges.
    - Use consistent variable names for package lists.  (Closes: #648177)
    - Compute the changes in restore_selections().
    - Check for settings.scriptsdir inside run_scripts().
    - Consistently use chroot.relative() to build filenames inside the chroot.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - Handle 'unknown-preferred-alternative' state correctly.
    - Add 'does-not-exist' state for dependency resolution to distinguish this
      from 'unknown' state so that the latter only indicates 'unresolvable' or
      'not yet resolved'.
    - Handle virtual packages separately from real packages.
    - Use get_package_state() internally which 'resolves' (purely) virtual
      packages by default (can be disabled).
  * piuparts-master.py:
    - Add a 'status' command that reports package counts for all states.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - Fix triggering tarball recreation.
    - Check tarball age regularily.
    - Log tarball creation in *.tgz.log.
    - Request and print package counts from master.
    - Reload section config every time a section is being run.
    - Add precedence attribute to allow prioritizing different sections and to
      suspend processing of low priority ones while there are packages waiting
      in more important sections.
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - state-*.html: Sort package lists by name, display state of all
      alternative dependencies and packages providing a virtual dependency.
    - source/?/*.html: Sort binary packages by name.
    - maintainer/?/*.html: Sort source packages by name.
    - Update list of error states to be highlighted.
    - Archive logs of packages that were removed from the distribution.
    - Speedup generating maintainer summaries.
  * Makefile: Use 'git describe' to get an exact stamp for development
    versions.

  [ Dave Steele ]
  * piuparts-slave.py: make Section.run() report the number of packages
    processed and use this to decide whether a slave should sleep.
    (Closes: #649967)

  [ Stefano Rivera ]
  * piuparts.py:
    - Properly install and remove logrotate.  (Closes: #638832)
    - Use eatmydata by default, add option --no-eatmydata. (This was discussed
      in #633033.)

piuparts (0.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py: Apply patch by Scott Schaefer to also consider
    alternative depends: the algorithm used to select the "best" alternative
    is:
     1) Prefer first alternative in state "essential-required"
     2) If no "essential-required" alternatives, prefer first alternative
        in state "successfully-tested"
     3) Otherwise, prefer first alternative in state
        "waiting-to-be-tested" IF NO REMAINING alternatives are in one of the
        "unknown/fail" states
    For this two new states have been introduced:
     a) "unknown-preferred-alternative": equivalent of "unknown", this defers
        calculation of this package's state, since one or more of its
        alternative depends are "unknown" (or
        "unknown-preferred-alternative"), and no alternative is either
        "essential-required" or "successfully-tested".  The alternatives will
        be re-tested on subsequest pass.
     b) "no-dependency-from-alternatives-exists": if none of the alternatives
        can be found in the archive.
    (Closes: #526045)
  * piuparts-report.py:
    - correct a typo from the patch for #523950.
    - make_stats_graph: draw the two new states as well.
    - point to source code in git instead of svn.
  * piuparts.py:
    - use proxy settings either from apt configuration or http_proxy
      environment variable, the latter overwriting the former (if present)
      - Thanks to Scott Schaefer for the patch. (Closes: #632046)
    - new option "--no-install-purge-test" to only do upgrade tests
      - Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for the patch (Closes: #588482)
    - run dpkg with --force-unsafe-io by default and introduce new option
      "--dpkg-noforce-unsafe-io" to disable this feature. (Closes: #633033)
      Thanks to Scott once more!
    - new option: "--fail-on-broken-symlinks". Remove option "--warn-symlinks"
      as this is the default now.
  * piuparts-slave:
    - check if chroot-tgz is older than max-tgz-age (defaulting to 30 days)
      and recreate it, if it is. Keep backup and put in back in place when
      debootstrapping a new chroot-tgz fails. Retry after min-tgz-retry-delay
      seconds. Thanks to Scott Schaefer for the patch. (Closes: #632924)
    - document new configuration options max-tgz-age and min-tgz-retry-delay
      in README.txt.
    - fix bug in piuparts-slave which prevented running a single section by
      including section name as command-line argument - thanks again to Scott
      and see 632924 too.
  * debian/control:
    - require python >= 2.6.6-3~, get rid of python-support build-depends.
    - add X-Python-Version: pseudo-header
  * debian/rules: use dh_python2 instead of python-support to build the
    package
  * Makefile: build for python 2.6 and 2.7 instead of 2.5 and 2.6.
  * Source code is now stored in git.
    http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=piuparts/piuparts.git
    git clone git+ssh://git.debian.org/git/piuparts/piuparts.git
    Thanks to Thomas Koch for setting those up and keeping history!
  * The configuration and scripts used on piatti.debian.org have also been
    moved to git, the URLs are the same, just s#piuparts#piatti#.
  * Add entry about git to NEWS.
  * Update Vcs-*-Headers in control to reflect move to git.

piuparts (0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * piuparts.py:
    - make "natty" the default Ubuntu distribution.
    - add to self.ignored_files:
      - /var/log/bootstrap.log
  * debian/control: depend on ${python:Depends} instead of just python. Thanks
    to Jakub Wilk. (Closes: #614617)

piuparts (0.39) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * The vintage of 2010 release!
  * piuparts-report.py:
     - report packages which failed
       - due to broken maintainer scripts,
       - due to output from cron after removal,
       - due to not enough force being,
       - due to a problem with pre-depends,
       - due to files having been modified after purge,
       - due to files having disappeared after purge and
       - due to problems configuring a database.
     - only report about (un)owned files and directories and symlink issues in
       sid - that's hardcoded as it's not practical to track them anywhere else
       anyway. And at least for broken symlinks this will also stay like this
       for a long time.
     - visual improvements in the output.
     - ignore udebs and binaries from other archs too.
     - graph is generated using all the available data points.
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - automatically break circular dependencies when there are only circular
      dependencies left, using a configurable list of circular depdencies in
      piuparts.conf (Closes: #526046)
        The list of circular depends is taken from a script written by Robert
      Lemmen available at http://debian.semistable.com/debgraph.out.html -
      obviously it would be better to merge this into piuparts directly.
        Note that the dependency resovler is still buggy, the state
      waiting-for-dependency-to-be-tested still contains some packages
      with failed depends (due to them being dependent on packages with
      circular depends). This bug has no effect other than that (so the state
      waiting-to-be-tested is calculated correctly). This bug is also no
      regression.
    - get rid of the longtime unused states "fixed" and "fix-not-yet-tested"
      (also in piuparts-master and piuparts-report).
    - forget reservations of untestable packages.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - fix crash when going into sleep when idle.
    - add support for only doing upgrade tests (without the basic test in the
      upgrade target distro).
    - honor mirror configuration option also for upgrade-tests.
    - also do upgrade tests if the version of a package being tested (the one
      in the upgraded distro) is not available in the distro being upgraded
      from. (This is a very short test, but a successfully one.)
    - make configuration setting "distro" to not default to any distro.
  * piuparts.py:
    - new option: --log-level to specify the verbosity of piuparts
      output. Thanks to Fabrice Coutadeur for the patch! (Closes: #567190)
    - new option: --warn-on-leftovers-after-purge to not fail if a package
      leaves files behind after purge. (Closes: #566599)
    - add to self.ignored_files:
      - /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/.delete-me-later
      - /var/log/alternatives.log (Closes: #591966)
      - /var/log/apt/history.log (Closes: #594964)
      - /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/fonts.alias (Closes: #576321)
    - add to self.ignored_patterns:
      - /etc/init.d/.depend.*
      - /var/mail(/.*)? - this used to be just /var/mail/.*
      - /var/lib//update-rc.d(/.*)? (Closes: #605127)
    - create temporary DEBIAN directory for the piuparts-depends-dummy package
      with 0755 perms regardless of the umask of the calling shell.
      (Closes: #573904)
    - fix --do-not-verify-signatures option (Closes: #574936) - thanks to
      Cleto Martin Angelina for the patch.
    - make Chroot.diff_meta_data() special case and ignore files matching
      (/etc/rc.\.d/)[SK][0-9]{2}(.*)$ so that piuparts doesn't complain about
      initscripts renamed by insserv. Thanks to by Andreas Beckmann for the
      patch! (Closes: #586793)
    - remove logrotate and depended packages after the test. (Closes: #602409)
      This is a fix for the incomplete patch for #566597. Again, this is a
      hardcoded list. :-(
    - new custom script: pre_remove_ (Closes: #539146)
    - set environment variable PIUPARTS_OBJECTS in custom scripts to a space
      separated list of packages / changes files being tested.
    - do not call apt-get with --no-remove when installing packages.
      (Closes: #603453)
    - apply patch by Andres Mejia to fix parsing of the --force-confdef option
      and also to configure apt to use that option. Thanks, Andres.
      (Closes: #605475)
    - don't panic if package is not known by apt-get, this probably just means
      a package not yet in the archive is being tested. (Closes: #566672)
      Thanks to Cleto Martin Angelina for the patch!
    - fix parsing of the options --end-meta and --save-end-meta.
    - supply help texts for --end-meta and --save-end-meta options, also add
      comments to install_and_upgrade_between_distros() to make the code
      easier to understand and hopefully improve in future. (Closes: #560050).
    - add logging to install_and_upgrade_between_distros() to point people to
      read the functions source code if they wonder why the log (for distro
      upgrade tests) looks like it looks.
  * piuparts.1.txt:
    - update the pointer to custom-scripts.txt to point to README.txt, as
      those two files have been merged. Thanks to Gregor Hermann for
      spotting this. (Closes: #574504)
    - indicate that it's possible to check several packages or .changes files
      at once.
    - update several options descritpions.
  * README.txt
    - better documentation of custom scripts.
    - reformat to achieve consistent width.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to Depends in debian/control.
  * Remove versioned dependencies on debootstrap as the version available
    in Etch is sufficient. Drop build-depends on dpkg-dev as it's in
    build-essential.
  * Build-depend on debhelper>=7 and use dh_prep instead of dh_clean -k, bump
    compat level to 7.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1, no changes necessary.
  * Remove Ian Jackson from uploaders - thanks for your work, Ian!
  * Makefile: support python 2.5 and 2.6 instead of 2.4 and 2.5, adjust

piuparts (0.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * piuparts.py:
    - Add support for using LVM snapshots. Thanks to
      Patrick Schoenfeld for the patch. (Closes: #559449)
    - Add support for warning on broken symlinks. Thanks to Carl Chenet for
      the patch. (Closes: #440151)  
    - Make --help usuable without needing to be run as root. (Closes: #547379)
    - --skip-minimize is now the default. This is because debootstrap is called
      with --variant=minbase instead of --resolv-deps now and because if a 
      base.tgz or an lvm snapshot is specified, piuparts should not touch it.
      (Closes: #539142, #559048)
      Introduce a new option, --minimize, to minimize a chroot with debfoster.
      (This is the old default behaviour. In future versions the --minimize
      option might be removed again.)
    - Add two new options: --keyring to specify the keyring to use with
      debootstrap (defaults to /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg)
      and --do-not-verify-signatures to not use --keyring with debootstrap.
      (Closes: #545907)
      In the chroots, APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated is set accordingly in
      /etc/apt/apt.conf.
    - Add new option, --pedantic-purge-test, to tell piuparts to be pedantic 
      when checking if a purged package leaves files behind. If this option is
      not set, files left in /tmp are ignored. (Closes: #528266)
    - Add new option, --dpkg-force-confdef, to make dpkg use --force-confdev,
      which lets dpkg always choose the default action when a modified conffile
      is found. This options will make piuparts ignore errors it was designed
      to report and therefore should only be used to hide problems in
      dependent packages. (Closes: #466118)
    - Add another type of custom-scripts, post_setup_, which are executed after
      the chroot was setup. (Closes: #466043)
    - Create policy-rc.d in 2nd chroot when using -b. (Closes: #466049)
      Thanks again to Patrick Schoenfeld for his help.
  * piuparts-report: report broken symlinks.
  * piuparts-slave: 
    - gracefully deal with upgrade-test-distros and upgrade-test-chroot-tgz 
      not being set in the configuration. Thanks to Carl Chenet and Patrick 
      Schoenfeld for the patch. (Closes: #519192)
    - new default value for idle-sleep, 300 instead of 10 seconds. Also the
      slave will now only sleep if there is nothing to do for any section.
  * Makefile: workaround 559305 by calling a2x twice.   
  * Update debian/NEWS.
  * Replace all references to sarge and etch with ones to lenny and squeeze.

piuparts (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * The "For me. For you. For everybody." release.
  * Break backwards compatibility of the configuration files for master-slave-
    mode. Merge those three into one: /etc/piuparts/piuparts/piuparts.conf.
    Introduce a new global section in piuparts.conf which is shared among the
    other sections there. 
  * piuparts.py:
    - add check whether scriptsdir exits, to fail gracefully if not. 
    - copy scriptsdir to chroot also when doing upgrade tests.
    - added to self.ignored_files:
      - /etc/shadow and /etc/shadow- (just as /etc/passwd* and /etc/group*)
      - /var/games (see #524461)
      - /etc/apt/trusted.gpg and /etc/apt/trusted.gpg~ (just as 
        /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg and other backup files)
    - added to self.ignored_patterns:
      -  /var/lib/dpkg/triggers/*
      -  /var/lib/ldap(/.*)? (see #527898)
      -  /var/backups/.*
    - modified self.ignored_patters:
      - ignore everything in /tmp, not just in /tmp/scripts (see #528266)
    - configure apt in chroots to not install recommends and suggests.
    - add support for scanning for packages in changes files, thanks to Andres
      Mejia for the patch. (Closes: #352940)
    - change some methods from using 'args' to 'package_list'. This more 
      accurately represents what is being passed into these methods now. 
    - add an optional parameter to panic() method to specify what exit status
      to use. Also thanks to Andres.
    - add advice how to read the logfile to the top of the logfiles produced.
    - add "FAIL: " to logging output for seven more failure types, so that it
      becomes easier to group failure causes.
    - allow piuparts to be stopped with control-C. Thanks to Carl Chenet for
      the patch. (Closes: #523958)
    - fail gracefully if piuparts is run as non-root user. Thanks to Ignace
      Mouzannar for the patch. (Closes: #538273)
  * piupartslib/packagesdb.py:
    - change the test whether a package is testable to check whether the 
      package is of priority "required", and not whether it's "Essential".
    - rename status "essential-required-important" to "essential-required" 
      as important packages can be tested like all the others.
    - handle binNMUs where the Source header in the Packages file includes the 
      Version and the Source package name in one line.
    - fix get_packages_in_state() to only return unique packages and not also 
      the provided ones as exact copies.
  * Install scripts for master-slave mode without .py extension.
  * piuparts-master.py: remove code to write statistics, that is done only in 
    piuparts-report.py now.
  * piuparts-slave.py:
    - support looping trough multiple sections in piuparts.conf via new config 
      value "sections". Thanks to Frank Ploss for writing this patch with me 
      and helping me understand the code much better!
    - allow the user to stop the slave with control-C.
    - call piuparts with --mirror when mirror is set in piuparts.conf.
  * Re-add piuparts-reports.py which got removed/lost between 0.14 and 0.20 
    without changelog entry.
  * piuparts-report.py: 
    - support sections in configuration file. 
    - support looping trough multiple sections in piuparts.conf via new config
      value "sections". 
    - generate counts.txt (per section) with raw numbers of packages per state,
      include these stats in the debug output (so it gets included in the mails
      send by cron.)
    - introduce new setting "sources-url" for piuparts.conf.
    - generate sources.txt (per section) with a summary status per source
      package (for the PTS to display a source packages piuparts state)
    - generate html status pages for all source packages (to link from the PTS)
      with links to state explaination and available logfiles, handle udebs.
    - provide links to logfiles in statistics page.
    - provide links to source packages pages from state pages and back, as well
      as links to the dependencies state.
    - draw graphs of package states over time (if pypthon-rpy and gs are 
      installed) - thanks to Thomas Viehmann and Dirk Eddelbüttel for
      inspiration and support.
    - create maintainer centric pages for each email address found in 
      Maintainers or Uploaders.
    - improve layout, generate navigation for all pages.
    - use icons to provide a quick overview of a source packages status. 
      (Thanks to tango.freedesktop.org for the icons!)
    - include index.tpl (if it exists) from output-directory into the
      generated index page, so one can add news to the index page without
      editing piuparts-report.py.
    - generate pages for known issues, which are detected by bash helper
      script, run by cron on piuparts.debian.org and available from 
      svn/piuparts/piatti/home/piupartsm/bin/detect_well_known_errors
  * Always use alphabetic time zone abbreviation in timestamps.
  * Makefile: 
    - add "~$date" to versionstring if building an unreleased version, thus
      adding dpkg-dev to build-depends.
    - split install target into install-doc, install-conf and install, to aid
      development and deployment from trunk.
  * debian/control: 
    - depend on python (>>2.4), make dependency to python-debian unversioned.
    - add build-dependencies on debhelper, asciidoc and xmlto.
    - dependency gs has been renamed to ghostcript
    - remove build-dependencies on docbook2x and docbook-xml.
    - suggest python-rpy and gs to improve piuparts-report output.
    - set Homepage: to http://piuparts.debian.org

      uploaders - thanks for your work!
    - Replace Ians email address with one that doesn't give an errorcode when
      sending mail to it
    - bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3, no changes necessary.
  * Rewrite debian/rules from scratch using debhelper.
  * Merge README, how-to-use-piuparts.txt and custom-scripts.txt into 
    README.txt, convert it to asciidoc and build pdf and html versions of it. 
  * Restructure and update README.txt to reflect the configuration changes in

  [ Lars Wirzenius ]
  * piuparts.py: Call "apt-get update" before calling Chroot.minimize, so
    that we can find the debfoster package on Ubuntu.
  * debian/control: Fixed "Uploaders:" to have my preferred e-mail address
    (liw@iki.fi) instead of my Debian one.
  * piuparts.py: Added -D option to set Debian flavor, plus two sets of
    default settings depending on the flavor, one for Debian itself, and
    another for Ubuntu. The settings choose default mirror and distribution
    set (sid vs gutsy). This will allow an Ubuntu version of the package
    to set defaults at package building time.
  * piuparts.py: Report target of broken symlink correctly, instead of
    saying "True".
  * piuparts.py: Use lsb-release to guess the Debian flavor.
  * debian/control: Added dependency on lsb-release.
  * piuparts-master.py: Make the master write summary of total pass/fail
    packages, plus status per binary package. This is for having the
    Debian PTS and the Ubuntu developer weather report show summaries
    of piuparts results.
  * integraged changes from Ubuntu by Ian Jackson to support autopkgtest.

  * Change the --warn-on-others implementation to create a dummy metapackage
    with the needed dependencies and install it in the chroot, rather than
    using "apt-get install package package-".  The previous implementation
    had issues when the package was already installed (and especially if the
    package had essential packages in its reverse dependencies).  This has
    the pleasant side-effect of making --warn-on-others work both with and
    without --apt. (Closes: #458929)
  * Fix a bug in check_for_broken_symlinks(): the targets for the broken

  * Fix the --warn-on-others option.  Now, dependencies are installed before
    the packages we wish to test, and an inventory is taken then, so that we
    can know which errors were caused by the packages explicitly specified on
    the command-line.  Currently, this requires --apt, and doesn't work quite

    will be tracked here.  (Closes: #389610)

    - Don't call shellquote() on arguments, since we're not using the shell.
