Description: .deb package installation, upgrading, and removal testing tool
 piuparts tests that .deb packages (as used by Debian) handle
 installation, upgrading, and removal correctly. It does this by
 creating a minimal Debian installation in a chroot, and installing,
 upgrading, and removing packages in that environment, and comparing the
 state of the directory tree before and after. piuparts reports any
 files that have been added, removed, or modified during this process.
 .
 piuparts is meant as a quality assurance tool for people who create .deb
 packages to test them before they upload them to the Debian package archive.

Description: piuparts master components
 piuparts is meant as a quality assurance tool for people who create .deb
 packages to test them before they upload them to the Debian package archive.
 A master/slave piuparts installation is used for testing complete archives
 as it is done on https://piuparts.debian.org/.
 .
 This package provides the piuparts-master, which needs one or more slaves to
 operate. It also contains piuparts-report to generate web pages with the
 testing results as well as documentation.
