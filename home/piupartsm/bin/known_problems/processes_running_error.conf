<p>
There were processes running inside the chroot at the end of the piuparts run.
This is probably due to directly calling /etc/rc.d/ scripts in packages maintainer scripts, which is a violation of policy 9.3.3.2 and must be replaced by using invoke-rc.d (which will respect an optionally existing policy-rc.d) - see 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.3.3">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.3.3</a>, /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.invoke-rc.d.gz and /usr/share/doc/sysv-rc/README.policy-rc.d.gz.
