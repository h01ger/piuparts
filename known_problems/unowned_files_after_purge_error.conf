WARNING: this list might contain false positives.
One group of them are packages with files in /usr/share/mime
- those are bugs from shared-mime-info (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/527063" target="_blank">#527063</a>) and have been ignored for this list.
There are probably others like this as well.
