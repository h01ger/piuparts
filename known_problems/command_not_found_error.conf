<p>
From the third paragraph about the meaning of the depends field in
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps" target="_blank">http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps</a>
</p>

<pre>
The Depends field should also be used if the postinst, prerm or postrm scripts
require the package to be present in order to run. __Note, however, that the
<b>postrm</b> cannot rely on any non-essential packages to be present during the
<b>purge</b> phase__.
</pre>

<p>
NOTE: it has not been verified that this error really caused the package to
fail the piuparts test, but it did fail.
<br>There are also successful logs with "command not found" (though not listed below).
