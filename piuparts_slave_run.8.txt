NAME
----
piuparts_slave_run - start up piuparts-slave instance(s) in screen

SYNOPSIS
--------
*piuparts_slave_run* ['SLAVE-NUMBERS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*piuparts_slave_run* runs piuparts-slave instance(s) in *screen* which run *piuparts* tests which test whether Debian packages handle installation, upgrading, and removal correctly.

By default, *piuparts_slave_run* will start the number of slaves specified by the 'slave-count' parameter in the piuparts.conf file. If 'slave-count' is not defined, a single slave will be started. If a single argument is supplied to *piuparts_slave_run*, consisting of a space-separated list of numbers between 1 and 'slave-count', only those slaves will be started.

OPTIONS
-------
There are no options to this command currently. Note however that *this interface is under development* and may change.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
Running piuparts in master-slave mode requires configuration in _/etc/piuparts_.

BUGS
----
*piuparts_slave_run* should be able to run slaves in different ways:
1. all, in a new screen (only this is implemented at the moment)
2. a specific one, in a specified screen slot in a (running) screen
3. append one to a (running) screen using a "random" slot
4. start slave in the current directory in the current shell in foreground.

NOTES
-----
Make sure to also read */usr/share/doc/piuparts-master/README_server.txt*.
